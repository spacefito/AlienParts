	description = This antimatter reactor was found near the edge of the solar system, along with the remains of what looked like a ship destroyed by an antimatter explosion. It looks in good condition. what could possibly go wrong? Just be ready to eject it if it turns purple. Also, no way to refuel it, limited antimatter left in it. Once the energy is gone, it is gone... If you want electricity... remmember, energy can never be destroyed, it can only be transformed.
